# Evenza - Smart Event Management & Resourcing Platform

**Evenza - Smart Event Management and Resourcing Platform** is my software design and development individual final project, which brings a unique solution to capture the process of event planning and management in a methodical way.

Frontend was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8 with `Angular Material` and `Angular MDBoostrap`. Progressive Web App generated with `Angular PWA`

Backend was developed using `NodeJs`, `Express` and `'MongoDB Atlas` as the real-time database. Project is comprising with a rich set of tools as, `JWT Authentication`, real-time interation with `socket.io`, reporting and visualizations with `ChartJs` & `MongoDB Charts`, personalized services recommendation with `TensorflowJs`, API documentation using `Swagger`, and hosted on `Google Cloud Platform`

The **Evenza** is an online event management and resourcing platform that serves the
functionality of an event manager as well as providing access to event related resources by
connecting relevant service providers to the customers .The core uniqueness is that proposed
system provides a solution for **planning and management** of an event as well as finding
necessary resources & service providers within the same platform. The project also provides
most of the basic to advanced functionalities required for an event-planner. It addresses
the current problems we face while planning an event, and provides a full-functional end-to-end solution to achieve a well-organized, timely and within the budget event with with maintaining resources and quality with the best services avaialable.
